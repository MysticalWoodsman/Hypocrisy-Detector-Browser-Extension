Transparency and Credibility

**Hypocrisy Score Formula:**

[ HScore = frac{HStates} over {TotStates} times 100]

Where:
- {HScore} is the overall hypocrisy score, expressed as a percentage.
- {HStates} is the number of detected hypocritical statements in the content.
- {TotStates} is the total number of statements or assertions analyzed in the content.

This formula calculates the hypocrisy score by dividing the number of hypocritical statements by the total number of 
statements and then multiplying by 100 to express the result as a percentage. A higher percentage indicates a 
higher level of detected hypocrisy in the analyzed content.

To further emphasize ideological neutrality and transparency, incorporate additional factors or considerations into the formula, such as:

1. **Weighted Analysis:** Assign weights to different types of statements or contexts based on their significance in determining hypocrisy. For example, statements from authoritative sources might carry more weight than personal opinions.

2. **Contextual Analysis:** Consider the context and nuances of statements, such as sarcasm, satire, or conditional statements, to avoid misinterpretation and false positives in the analysis.

3. **Source Credibility:** Evaluate the credibility and bias of sources referenced in the content to ensure a balanced and accurate analysis.

4. **Thresholds and Ranges:** Define thresholds or ranges for interpreting the hypocrisy score, such as categorizing scores into low, medium, and high hypocrisy levels to provide clearer insights to users and investors.

We are Committed to ideological neutrality, fairness, and accuracy in evaluating content for hypocrisy.
